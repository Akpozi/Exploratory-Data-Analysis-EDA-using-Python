Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python — E-sports Earnings 1998 to 2021

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps in the understanding of data. It is an important "Analyst and Scientist" routine, which gives you the vision of all your data. It´s special because it will allow you to define the data you should mantain in the dataset and the ones you should discard.

Pandas Library, that is essential tool for any analysis will be used for the EDA with the following steps below:

## Steps:
- Import Libraries
- Know your dataset
- Data Cleaning
- Data Visualization
- Ask Questions to your dataset
- Brainstorming
- Making imformed decisions

## Dataset: [Kaggle E.sports datasets](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/external-link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaggle.com%2Fdatasets%2Frankirsh%2Fesports-earnings%2Fdownload%3FdatasetVersionNumber%3D17)


## Importing Library’s
For EDA we will use the following python libraries:
- pandas: for Data manipulation
- seaborn: for Data visuzlization
- matplotlib.pyplot: for Data visuzlization
